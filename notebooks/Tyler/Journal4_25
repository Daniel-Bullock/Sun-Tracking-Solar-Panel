Today I worked on the motor driver, which was having issues sending power to turn the motors. We realized we incorrectly wired the PS pin on the motor driver to ground, so it was never telling the motor to move. To attempt to fix this we removed the motor driver from the pcb, and covered the right pads with electrical tape to remove the connection to ground for the PS pin. The fact that the tilt motor was not powerful to lift the panel, that function was scrapped, thus we did not need any other pins on the right side besides PS and a 5 volt power pin. During the process of resoldering the motor driver to the pcb, and soldering wires to the pins we still wished to use, the motor driver was damaged, and no longer functioned. With limited time before our demo, we decided to bypass the motor driver and have the microcontroller directly control the horizontal motor. Today we also connected the photoresistors to the solar panel flaps, and were able to collect and read data from the photoresistors to support the sun tracking algorithm.
