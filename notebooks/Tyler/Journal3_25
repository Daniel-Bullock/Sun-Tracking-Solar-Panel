Cleaned up the code for the microcontroller today. i added comments to explain the logic of the algorithm, and defined several global variables to replace magic numbers in my code. The biggest issue with the code is that I am uncertain of what values I must send to the motor driver to turn the motors a specified amount. I have read the data sheets and am sure I know how to choose which direction the motor moves. However, I am not sure what to set the pwm value for a single update of the panel. I theorize I will select a uniform time delay that the motor will turn for, and then quantify that into a current position of each motor using the encoder values.
