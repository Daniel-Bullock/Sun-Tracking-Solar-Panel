During the process of testing the microcontroller, we ended up destroying it. We did not realize that the design of our pcb had 5 volts coming from the progammer in series with the 5 volts we were providing to the microcontroller from a battery. This ended up sending 10 volts to the microcontroller, which broke it. For the rest of the day we continued testing different aspects of the project with an arduino, and plan on getting another ATMEGA328P microcontroller by removing it from an arudino board we will buy from the supply center.
