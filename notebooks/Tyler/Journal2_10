Today the group met on Discord. We completed the project proposal and submitted it. We now have a clearer
idea of our project, but still need to finalize details with Ghoname and the machine shop.
We need to calculate the maximum torque our motors can handle to design the photoresistor setup.
Also, we must decide how we will control the amount of movement the motors produce.
