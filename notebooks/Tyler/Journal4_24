Today we worked on attempting to get the motors to work with the motor driver and microcontroller logic. We traced all voltage values across the pcb and ensured the motor driver was getting the correct signals from the microcontroller. We also tested that when directly connected to power, the motor will turn. I personally resoldered the microcontroller to ensure that all connections were being made. We believe the issue is that we aren't producing enough current for the motors to turn the solar panel, and will return to the lab tomorrow to try and fix this.
