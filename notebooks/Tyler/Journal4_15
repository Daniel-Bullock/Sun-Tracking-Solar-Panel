I made a small update to the sun tracking alogrithm today. To optimize the logic further, I decided to include an extra check when deciding which direction to orient the solar panel. Prior to this, each loop would see a check for the horizontal photresistors, and a rotation if necessary, followed by a check of the vertical photresistors, and a tilt if necessary. Now, I check the percent difference of photresistor values of each axis first, and then choose to move across the axis that has the greater percent difference, assuming it is at least a difference of 5%. This prioritizes turning in the direction that will producde a greater power production increase, rather than iterating through checking both axes every loop.
