Today we received our solar panel back from the machine shop. It includes a metal base, and the solar panel mounted on arm that rotates and tilts. We tested the functionality of the motors, and discovered that while the rotation of the solar panel works when given power, the tilt motor does not. It appears as though the weight of the solar panel and frame holding the solar panel is to heavy for the motor. When given power, the motor tries to spin, but stutters under the weight of the solar panel setup. This appears ot have stripped the connection of the motor to the gearbox, as further testing appears to provide no torque to the panel. At this point it seems that we may have to scrap the tilting functionality of the solar panel.
