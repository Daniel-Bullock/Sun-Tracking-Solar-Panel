Met with the group on Discord. We discussed preplanning ideas and concerns we have for our project.
We talked about our solar panel idea, and how we should intake data to control the angle it points.
Also, we mentioned concern for the power usage to power generated ratio our solar planel might produce.
Finally, we began working on our project proposal, including a high level block diagram, system descriptions, and a simple diagram of what the project should look like.
