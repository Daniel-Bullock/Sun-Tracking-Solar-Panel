Today I modifided the code for the sun tracking algorithm to include checks to prevent the solar panel from turning too much. For example, if the solar panel decides it wants to keep rotating in one direction, the wires from the photoresistors will get tangled. The solution is too preven the solar panel from turning once it turns 180 degrees in each direction from its starting position. For the tilt motor, turning too far in either direction may press the solar panel into the structure, damaging the panel. To prevent this I only allow the motor to tilt about 75 degrees in either direction from its initial normal position.
