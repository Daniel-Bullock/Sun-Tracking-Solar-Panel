Having given up on using the microcontroller on the pcb, we decided to use an arduino board to control most of the logic. However we still need to use the pcb to handle the current output of the solar panel, and to control the motor driver. The solution was for me to carefully resolder all our pieces on to a new pcb, including the motor driver, headers, and passive components. Instead of soldering the microcontroller, I instead soldered wires to the pads of the microcontroller footprint that were still necessary. During this process, the wires attached to the microcontroller pads ended up pulling the pads off of the pcb. The solution was to try again, but use electrical tape to hold the wires down.
