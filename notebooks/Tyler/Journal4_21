Today the programmer we ordered for the microcontroller arrived, as well as the chip we will be using to track power statistics from the solar panel. The chip however came on a breakout board, so I desoldered the chip from that board and on to our pcb. The goal today was to test the microcontroller code with the motor driver, however we got errors every time we tried to program the microcontroller. Despite ensuring all our settings were correct on arduino ide, ensuring the microcontroller was receiving the correct voltages, and ensuring that every leg of the microcontroller was soldered correctly to the board, nothing worked. At this point, with limited time, we decided it was better for us to continue using the arduino board we have been using for testing, for the final design.
