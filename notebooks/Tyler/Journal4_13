I decided to improve the logic for reading data from the photoresistors. Instead of making a decision purely on a single reading of each photoresistor, I collect 100 data readings from each photoresitor, and compare the average values. I perform one reading every second, so the decision to move the panel is made from readings across 100 seconds of time. This process should hopefully reduce improper turns due to outliers such as something like a cloud shading a photoresistor for a few seconds. This logic however is flexible to change based off testing, depending on if we need to take more or less readings to improve efficiency.
