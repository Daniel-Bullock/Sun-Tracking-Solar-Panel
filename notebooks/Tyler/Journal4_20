Today, when testing sending power to our pcb, it appears that the voltage regulators are not working properly. Specifically the 12 volt regulator seems to have broke as it doesnt output any substantial voltage. We believe the circuit we designed for the regulators did not work. We bought some new regulators from the supply center, and ended up transitioning the voltage regulator portion of our circuit schematic on to a breadboard with a diffrent design. This design change succeeded in producing the correct voltage values, which we can send to the pcb using headers where the voltage regulators were supposed to go.
